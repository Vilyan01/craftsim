# Craftsim

Craftsim is a work-in-progress simulator for calculating the viability and weight limits of a drone. The idea is to be able to pass in a set of parameters such as prop efficiency, lift/drag coefficient of a body, and areas of props and wings to be able to simulate the flight profile of a drone with different payloads.

For now the simulation is limited to fixed-wing drones, but ultimately I would like to expand it to include quadcopters as well.

**Disclaimer:** I am not a physicist by any means, most of the formulas I use for the physics engine I just find on Google or ChatGPT. I just wanted a project to work on using C++ since it has been a while and I wanted to see what's new.
